# GAME OF CHECKERS
// THE GAME I AM CHOOSING TO MAKE IS CHECKERS
 # RULES
  THE GAME CONSISTS OF AN 8X8 BOARD WITH 12 PIECES ON EACH SIDE CALLED 'CHECKERS' FOR EACH PLATER.
1 THERE ARE 24 PIECES ON THE BOARD 12 (RED) AND 12 (WHITE)
2 EACH PLAYER TAKES TURNS MAKING THEIR MOVE WITH RED GOING FIRST
3 THE GAME IS WON WHEN ONE OF THE PLAYERS CAPTURES ALL OF THEIR OPPONENTS PIECES
4 THE PIECES CAN ONLY MOVE DIAGNOLLY WHETHER MOVING FORWARD OR CAPTURING YOUR OPPONENETS PIECES
5 CAPTURING REQUIRED YOUR PIECE TO 'HOP' OVER YOUR OPPONENTS WHICH MEANS THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EMPTY SPACE BEHIND SAID PIECE TO CAPTURE. 
6 IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE OPEN SPACES YOU CAN CAPTURE MORE THAN ONE. 
7 A PIECE THAT REACHES THE END OF THEIR OPPONENTS BOARD BECOMES A 'KING' PIECE AND CAN MOVE IN ANY DIRECTION INSTEAD OF JUST DIAGNOL. 

 # USER EXPERIENCE
 AS A USER I WANT TO BE ABLE TO
1 ALTERNATE BETWEEN RED AND BLACK CHECKERS PIECES PER TURN BECAUSE PLAYERS USE DIFFERENT PIECES
2 MOVE THE CAPTURED PIECES TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CORNERS TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY PIECES ARE CAPTURED
3 KEEP TRACK OF THE WINING SCORE FOR BOTH PLAYERS AND IF THEY GET A TIE.
4 SET A TIMER FOR 5 MINUTES WHERE THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST PIECES WILL WIN
